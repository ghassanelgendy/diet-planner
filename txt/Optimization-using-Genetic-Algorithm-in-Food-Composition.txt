Abstract: This paper aims to process daily food consumption based on the Guideline to Healthy Food or the principle of Healthy 4 
Perfect 5 (H4P5). The Guideline to Healthy Food does not include the portion and size of daily food consumption, therefore it is 
perfected into the Guidelines to Balanced Nutrition (GBN). GBN is performed by consuming three servings of protein vegetables , 
three servings of animal protein, e ight servings of carbohydrates, five servings of vegetables, five servings of fruits, and eight 
servings of water.  Each part of the portion has a proportional size and dose based on GBN. The portions are measured by food  
composition using the optimization  process using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Optimization by a using Genetic Algorithm yielded 
three outputs, namely, first, the initial objective function (0) compared to the generative objective function (1) produces a  value of 
6.13: 4.72 (there is an increa se in chromosomes, because, the smaller the value, the better the chromosome is). Second, probability 
mutation is 50% of mutation rate, crossover probability is 5%, the maximum generation is 36, the maximum fitness point is 
0.240806, and the size of the po pulation is 6. Third, optimization using the Genetic Algorithm in food composition produces one 
food model, one consumption model, and one composition model. Thus, the result of this research (food model, consumption mode l, 
and composition model) can be a recommendation for food consumption patterns (normal condition) and a reference for national 
food consumption policies.  
 
 
Keywords:  Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, Food Composition  
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
Optimization is a set of problems in mathematics to 
obtain a unique and optimum value. It is used for 
computational problems with algorithms that are based on 
mathematical models [1]. One of the mathematical models 
is a combination model. This combination uses 
mathematical equations for combinations of food 
composition based on balanced nutrition [2]. Balanced 
nutrition is food containing nutrients from food sources as 
energy -producing substances (carbohydrates and fats), 
food sources as regulator substance s (vegetable and animal 
protein), and food sources as protective substances (water, 
vitamin, and minerals). The function of balanced nutrition 
is to maintain and strengthen endurance, maintain balanced 
body weight, increase disease resistance, and improve 
healthy life quality. Based on normal portions and general 
standards in all groups in Indonesia, the compositions of 
food with balanced nutrition for daily consumption are 2 -3 
servings of vegetable protein, 2 -3 servings of animal 
protein, 3 -8 servings of c arbohydrates, 3 -5 servings of vegetables, 3 -5 servings of fruits, and 8 servings of water 
(2 liters). Each portion is based on minimum nutritional 
requirements [3].

In this paper, Table 1 suggests some healthy messages. 
First, the Healthy Eating Guideline (HEG) with Healthy 4 
Perfect 5 pattern emphasizes the message of food

http://journals.uob.edu.bh  consumption on the importance of consumption of rice, 
side dishes, vegetables, fruits as staple  foods. Secondly is 
the importance of consuming milk as a separate food or 
drink. Because of its nutritional content namely protein 
and minerals, it is beneficial to complement perfect food 
consumption. Third, there is no exact portion size of food 
to be c onsumed in one day in HEG. Fourth, the 
importance of drinking water (the quantity of water 
needed for consumption is not explained, neither is the 
quantity of mineral drinking water).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Structure of paper  
 
Based on Figure 1, in this paper, the structure of the 
process consists of several elements. Firstly, the food 
element is a food data source element. Secondly, Healthy 4 
Perfect 5 pattern as Guide 1 and Balanced Nutrition as 
Guide 2. Thirdly, optimization is a process for determining 
the portion and composition problems. Fourthly, a 
combination model in mathematical form. Fifthly, the 
Genetic Algorithm is a method of how to produce 
mathematical solutions. Sixthly, solution as output 
(alternative solution 1 and solution 2). Seventhly or lastly, 
output as optimal optimization (food menu, food nutrition, 
meal times, and food composition based on Food Model, 
Consumption Model, and Composition Model).  
The Guideline of Balanced Nutrition is a healthy 
message by em phasizing the consumption of food with food composition containing nutrient elements that suits 
the needs of the body, using 7 principles, namely regularly 
eating a variety of foods, maintaining a clean lifestyle, 
exercising, and weight monitoring, drinkin g milk, (milk is 
included in the complementary/non -food group), replacing 
milk with other food/drinks with similar or equal 
nutritional value, measuring the portion of the 
amount/size/food that must be consumed for each type of 
food, and drinking mineral w ater with an explanation of 
drinking 2 liters of mineral water or 8 glasses per day. A 
composition framework is displayed in Figure 2.  
 
Figure 2. Composition framework  
 
Optimization of food composition needs to be done to 
get the optimal solution for foo d consumed based on the 
Healthy 4 Perfect 5 pattern and Guidelines of Balanced 
Nutrition (GBN). The optimal solution is used to obtain the 
right food composition. The right food comes from the 
right menu, balanced nutrition, a regular schedule, and 
proport ional food composition. The food framework is 
displayed in Figure 3.  
 
 
Figure 3. Food framework  
 
First, why is the diet important? In planning a food 
menu, it is very important to select the right food menu. A 
healthy diet must meet the amount and variety  of 
nutritious foods and the types of nutrients needed by the

http://journals.uob.edu.bh  body. A nutritious diet is needed for optimal growth and 
the acquisition of nutrients to strengthen the immune 
system. The food menu must be based on the Healthy 4 
and Perfect 5 pattern which co nsists of rice, side dishes, 
vegetables, fruit, and milk while an improved diet is based 
on the Guidelines of Balanced Nutrition, namely vegetable 
protein, animal protein, carbohydrates, vegetables, fruit, 
and water.  
Second, why is food nutrition important ? The answer is 
because nutrition can help growth, improve the function of 
body organs, and provide protection from the risk of 
diseases. Moreover, the nutritional imbalance can trigger 
malnutrition which in turn can result in slow growth 
(stunting). The c omponents of balanced nutrition are 
carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and 
water.  
Third, why is eating time important? A good mealtime 
is defined as a meal schedule with a regular schedule at 
the right time. Eating at the wrong time can affect health. 
Skipping meals also affects the balance of bodily 
functions as the human body works according to 
biological working hours which affects mealtime. 
Delaying meal times can affect digestion and metabolic 
disorders. Therefore, the best way t o manage your eating 
schedule is to know when to eat and what portions to 
support the activities that will be carried out. A good 
eating schedule consists of breakfast (at 05:00 - 09.00 in 
the morning), morning mini -meal or snack (10:00 
morning), lunch (12 :00 - 13:00 noon), afternoon mini -
meal or snack (15:00 - 16:00 afternoon), and dinner (7:00 
- 80:00 pm).  
Fourth, why is the composition important? Food 
composition is very important for the body. The food must 
meet the number of calories, portion of food, type of food, 
amount of nutrition, nutritional value, amount of 
consumption, and the amount of energy needed by the 
body. Most importantly the food is consumed according to 
the right eating schedule. Food consumption is based on 
GBN, which consists of 3 se rvings of vegetable protein, 3 
servings of animal protein, 8 servings of carbohydrates, 5 
servings of vegetables, 5 servings of fruit, and 8 servings 
of water.    
2. RELATED WORK 
One popular computational algorithm for optimization 
problems is the Genetic Algorithm [4]. A Genetic 
Algorithm has been proposed by many researchers on food 
problems. Among the researches are combination menus 
on cholesterol prevention [5], food compositi on for 
patients with diabetes mellitus [6], food composition for 
patients with high blood pressure 7], food composition for 
hypertensive patients [8], nutritional status can be 
influenced by balanced nutritional behavior [9], media 
promotion the tagline “M y Dishes” [10], and the influence 
of media on web -based and Android nutrition education 
[11]. The guideline of balanced nutrition is also very important to determine the combination of the composition 
of food consumed. This combination problem requires the  
right solution with GBN as it is very necessary for a 
nutritious diet. Nutritious food menus are needed for food 
nutrition standards and food nutrition must be by food 
composition. Food composition needs to be consumed on 
the right eating schedule. Combin ations of a nutritious and 
varied diet need to be made because food nutrition requires 
a variety of foods with optimal composition. More 
importantly, optimal food composition needs to be 
consumed at the right time. Thus, this optimization is 
needed to prod uce an optimal composition with the right 
combination for food consumption. Food consumption 
with optimal composition and the right combination can 
improve the quality of life of healthy people and reduce 
the risk of illness. This strategy can be one way t o 
improve public health for approximately 260 million of 
Indonesia’s population. Because there has not been a clear 
or proper composition of the guideline of healthy food and 
there is no optimal scheduling in the guidelines of 
balanced nutrition, optimizat ion is highly needed. The 
proposed method is by optimization using a Genetic 
Algorithm to obtain a clear food composition and optimal 
scheduling. Therefore, this method is expected to be a 
recommendation for food consumption patterns and can 
be a reference  for national food consumption policies.  
The main contributions of this work are summarized as 
follows:  
 The paper presents a novel genetic algorithm based 
on the food consumption algorithm. The idea 
presented in the paper is very useful for the society 
where most of the peoples are unable to take a healthy 
diet.  
 The authors implemented in the form of 3 models: the 
Consumption Model, the Food Model, and the 
Composition Model.  
 The paper presented a novel method for maintaining a 
healthy diet plan. The gen etic algorithm has been 
used to design a novel model for a healthy diet plan.  
 In this paper, optimization was applied using a 
genetic algorithm for food processing scenarios. The 
result of this research can be a recommendation for 
food consumption patterns . 
 This paper presented using a genetic algorithm to 
optimize food composition based on guidelines of 
healthy food and balanced food. This study somehow 
showed interesting finds for a new guideline and can 
be recommended for Indonesian people in normal 
cond ition (excluded pregnant, baby, children, and 
older) and also depend on their activities (excluded 
working hard, bodybuilder athletes, and food 
addiction).

The proposed method consists of five elements are the 
data model, optimization, Gen etic Algorithm, food 
composition, and solution.  
A. Data Model  
The daily food consumption data model is explained by 
the mathematical model in equation (1).

    (1) 
 
Where a is the portion of consumption of vegetable 
protein, b is the portion of animal protein, c is the portion 
of carbohydrate consumption, d is the portion of vegetable 
consumption, e is the portion of fruit consumption, and f is 
the portion of water consumption, and 24 the time of hours 
in one day ((24 hours to achieve 100%).  
B. Optimization  
Optimization is performed using the Genetic Algorithm 
in food composition. One application of the Genetic 
Algorithm is solving combinations with mathematical 
models. This optimization aims to get an optimal value of 
the solution for a problem that has many solutions. The 
optimization model is illustrated in the framework 
displayed in Figure 4.  
 
Figure 4. Optimization framework  
 
A framework is used to find a solution to the problem 
of food composition. The framework consists of 
Optimization, Data, Genetic Algorithm, Food 
Composition, and Solutions. Data models are based on 
mathematical models. The optimization uses the Genetic 
Algorithm. The food composition is based on 
optimization. Output is a model for optimal solutions.    
C. Genetic Algorithm  
Based on Flowchart [12], the Genetic Algorithm can 
solve combinatorial optimization problems for simple 
solutions. A solution produced in the Genetic Algorithm is 
called a Chromosome. Chromosome collection is called 
Population. A chromosome is formed from a component 
called a Gene. Genes can have values in the form of 
numeric numbers, binaries, symbols, characters depending 
on the problem yo u want to solve. Chromosomes will 
evolve continuously called Generation. In each generation, chromosomes are evaluated on the success rate of the 
solution to the problem to be solved (objective function) 
with a measure called Fitness. To select chromosomes  that 
will be retained for the next generation, a process called 
Selection is carried out.  
The chromosomes selection process with a high Fitness 
Point has a great chance to be re -elected in the next 
generation. The new chromosome called Offspring is 
forme d by cross -breeding in a generation called Crossover. 
The number of chromosomes undergoing crossover is 
determined by a parameter called the Crossover Rate. The 
process of changing one or more gene values in a 
chromosome with a random number is called the Mutation 
Rate. A solution produced from several generations with 
chromosomes with the value of gene convergence. 
Convergence value is the optimal solution (best solution) 
from the Genetic Algorithm. Optimization using the 
Genetic Algorithm is done to solve  the problem of 
combination using a computer (computing) based on the 
paper [13]. The process of computing the Genetic 
Algorithm is described in the form of the flowchart shown 
in Figure 5.

D. Food Composition  
Food composition is based on Balanced Nutrition 
Guidelines for daily food consumption. Various types of 
food, various menu choices, time of consumption, and the 
portion are based on normal calorie needs  per person per 
day. Daily food intake is adjusted to the number of calories 
and nutritional value to the needs of pe ople under normal 
condition s (except for infants, toddlers, children, pregnan t 
women, sick  people , and elderly  people ). Food 
composition will be converted into mathematical model s.

http://journals.uob.edu.bh  E. Solution  
The solution is produced from several generation s with 
chromosome genes whose  value converge s as optimal 
solutions from several combinations. An optimal solution 
is generated in a Genetic Algorithm called Best 
Chromosome  with a process called Encoding . The 
returning process called  Decoding will produce the 
convergence value into the best value as a solution.  
4. RESULT  AND DISCUSSION  
A. Data Model  
The Data Model is used to create mathematical models. 
Based on Table 2, these components are converted into 
mathematical models. The model used for solving 
combination problems is based on equation (1). The food 
component consists of vegetable protein with portions 
three times and is symbolized by symbol a. this means that 
the consumption of a variety of foods containing vegetable 
protein, the consumption schedule is five times a day 
(morning, morning mini -meal or snack, lunch, afternoon 
mini-meal or snack, and dinner). Consumption is valid for 
1 day or 24 hours. This consumption pattern applies 
normally to every individual in a healthy condition. The 
same thing was done for animal protein (symbol b), 
carbohydrates ((symbol c), vegetables (symbol d), fruit 
(symbol e), and water (symbol f). Consumption of food in 
the size of one meal, foods that contain protein, 
carbohydrates, vegetables, fruits, and vitamins and 
minerals contained in a variety of foods. The data model is 
displayed in Table 2.

B. Optimization  
Optimization is done by finding the best solution from 
many alternatives. Optimization can produce more than 
one solution.

Table 13 shows the application of solution 1 and solution 
2 for consumption per day and Solution 1 and Solution 2 with 3 meals for daily consumption (morning, afternoon, 
and night) and mini -meal or snack consumption based on 
food consumption in Table 5.  
 
Table 14 shows the composition and combination of daily 
food consumption. The consumption pattern is with 3 -3-8-
5-5-8 pattern (3 x consumption for vegetable protein, 3 x 
consumption for animal protein, 8 x consumption for 
carbohydrate, 5 x consumption for vegetables, 5 x 
consumption for fruit, and 8 x water consumption) based 
on food consumption in Table 5. The regula r meal -times 
are breakfast, morning mini -meal or snack, lunch, 
afternoon mini -meal or snack, and dinner. This pattern 
applies to initialization (initial state) and mutation (final 
state). This pattern yields outputs, namely: Consumption 
Model, Food Model, and Composition Model.  
 
5. CONCLUSION  
Optimization using the Genetic Algorithm on Food 
Composition can be performed and can produce a 
combination with two solutions , namely optimal solution 
as a combination of food component that can meet daily 
food needs, c onsisting of the right menu, nutrition, time, 
composition with the computational process . In this  
computational process for the Genetic Algorithm , the 
mutation rate is 50%, the crossover rate  is 5%, the 
maximum generate is 36, the maximum fitness point is 
0.240806, and the population size is 6. This Genetic 
Algorithm used genotype 1 variable s (integer), 
initialization (random value /random number ), evaluation 
(objective function  is convert ed to fitness point function), 
selection (roulette whee  model ), geneti c operator ( the real 
value  of recombination), crossover (binary value  of 
recombination), and mutation (real value). The optimal 
from this research implemented in the form of 3 models: 
the Consumption Model, the Food Model, and the 
Composition Model. The re sulting model has a large 
impact on food composition patterns  with an optimal 
composition  of the main food in improving health and 
minimizing malnutrition in Indonesia . In future work, 
subsequent research will be o ptimization using Particle 
Swarm Optimizat ion (PSO more stable for the result of the 
fitness) for alternative food compositions .
